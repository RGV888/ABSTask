## ABS TASK 
 
This project demonstrates a simple Android app that fetches a list of users based on a count entered by the user. It utilizes the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Jetpack Compose for the UI, Coroutines for asynchronous operations, and Kotlin as the programming language. The app has two main screens:

User List Screen: Where the user can input the number of users they want to fetch and display the user list.
User Detail Screen: Displays detailed information about a selected user.
